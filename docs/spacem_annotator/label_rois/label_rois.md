# Label Regions of Interest
When you have selected the regions of interest, you can start labeling. Creating manual annotations can be done using two different software:
```{toctree}
---
maxdepth: 1
---
napari_labeling
quapth_labeling
```

Please note that the support for QuPath is still experimental and under development.
