# Getting started

## Installation
The tool has already been installed on the following machines: **TODO**.


### Local installation
If you prefer to install on your laptop, you will need [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). Once you have `conda`, open a terminal and run the following command:
:::{code-block} shell
conda create --name spacem_annotator_env -c abailoni -c conda-forge spacem_annotator
:::

## Running SpaceM annotator
After being installed, you can start a new project by typing the following two commands in a shell:

```shell
conda activate spacem_annotator_env
python -m spacem_annotator
````

## Selecting a project directory
After starting SpaceM Annotator, you will be asked to select the project directory.

**What is the project directory?** It is the folder containing all the generated data and images. If you are starting a new annotation project, then create and select an empty folder. Otherwise, select the directory of an existing annotation project.

::::{tip}
You can also pass the path of the project directory as a command line argument when you run SpaceM Annotator:
:::{code-block} shell
python -m spacem_annotator --proj_dir /path/to/the/project/directory
