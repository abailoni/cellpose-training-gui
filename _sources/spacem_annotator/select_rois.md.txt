# Select Regions of Interest

After clinking on _"Select Regions of Interest"_ in the starting window of the annotation tool, a napari viewer will open and let you add images to the project and then select regions of interest. 

## What are regions of interest? 
After adding an image to the project, you will need to select one or more region of interests (rectangular boxes) that will indicate the parts of the image that you want to manually annotate and that will be used in the following to train the segmentation algorithm. 

### How to select good regions of interest
When you select a region of interest, keep in mind that **you will need to manually annotate all cells inside that region of interest**. Each region of interest should contain **at least several dozens of cells, ideally ~100**. 

These region of interests will be used to train the segmentation algorithm, so you should **select the most representative parts of your data**. If there are some particularly challenging parts of your data the you would like the segmentation algorithm to properly segment, then you should also select some regions of interest from these difficult parts. 

### Some example cases
Here there are some possible scenarios describing how you should proceed while choosing the regions of interest:

- Your images/datasets present several artifacts close to the borders, but you only care to have an accurate segmentation in the central part of the image, where image quality is higher and there are no artifacts. In this case, you can select regions of interest only from the central area of your image.
- Your images/datasets present several artifacts in all parts of the image, and you would like cells to be properly segmented even in parts of the image where these artifacts are present. Then, you should also include regions of interest where artifacts are present (but you should also include regions that are easier to segment)
- You acquired several images that look somehow different (different acquisition method, brightness, etc). Then, you should select regions of interest across all your images/datasets.

## Adding images to the annotation project
### Adding the first image
:::{figure} ./images/add-new-image.jpg
:::
On the right side of the napari viewer, select the paths of an image you want to add to the project (either insert the path manually or click on the _Select file_ buttons).

For each image, you can add up to four channels:

- **Main channel**: This is the main channel that will be used for segmentation (usually it is the bright-field channel)
- **DAPI channel**: If available, add a DAPI channel because it often improves segmentation results
- **Extra channels**: If you have additional channels that may be helpful for the manual annotation process, you can load them. They won't be used by the segmentation algorithm though.

After you select the files with the image channels, click on _Update Displayed Image Channels_: this will load the image in napari and add it to the project. 

## Modify / create regions of interest in Napari
After you run the next cell, the selected image will be loaded in Napari. 

Then select the "Rectangle" tool in napari to draw one or more region of interests.

After you are done, close the Napari window and run the  the next sections 

- Select, move, and delete boxes
- Insert image of Napari viewer? (Showing the various buttons)
