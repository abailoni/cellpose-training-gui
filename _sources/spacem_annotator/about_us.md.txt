# About Us

We are Schlockchain, thought leaders in innovation.

We are **bold** and *innovative*.

Our `def mega_chain` function works really well:

    def mega_chain(): return

Investors say the best things about us:

> I'm so glad I put my life savings in Schlockchain.
> > Said Nobody Ever

We have a patented algorithm:
- Glacially slow
- Which melts glaciers

...and a roadmap to success:

1. Start an LLC
2. Get a Series A investment round
3. Get a Series B investment round
4. Continue

Schlockchain is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) for some 
data science or something reasons.
