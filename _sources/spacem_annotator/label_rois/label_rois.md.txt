# Annotate Regions of Interest
When you have selected regions of interest, you can start manually annotating. Currently, creating manual annotations can be done both in Napari and QuPath:
```{toctree}
---
maxdepth: 1
---
napari_labeling
quapth_labeling
```

Please note that the support for QuPath is still experimental and under development.
