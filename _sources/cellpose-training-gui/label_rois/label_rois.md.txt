:::
When you have selected regions of interest, you can start manually segmenting cells/instances in your images. This can be done both in Napari and QuPath:
```{toctree}
---
maxdepth: 1
---
quapth_labeling
napari_labeling
```

## Using external software (e.g. Cellpose)

:::{image} ../images/export-input-data.jpg

:align: right
:::
Click on the `Show Cellpose Input Images` button to get the cellpose input images that can be processed using the [Cellpose](https://www.cellpose.org) software or other annotation programs.

::::{note}
In the cellpose input images generated by the `traincellpose` tool, the green channel represents the main segmentation channel and the red channel is the DAPI channel (otherwise set to zero if DAPI is not present)
